## 🚀 About the Project

F1 races aren't won just on track — they're won by *strategy*.  
Yet, accessing powerful strategy simulations has always been reserved for multi-million-dollar teams.

**RaceCraft democratizes F1 strategy** — allowing users to:
- Simulate real race scenarios
- Predict pit stop strategies
- Analyze undercut and overcut opportunities
- Estimate winning probabilities
- Plan qualifying-to-race strategies
- Visualize lap-by-lap race simulations
- Model outcomes dynamically based on historical race and driver behavior

Built using extensive F1 datasets (2000+ races, drivers, lap times, pit stops, circuits, and more), **RaceCraft** combines **machine learning**, **dynamic analysis**, and an **interactive chatbot interface** to offer **real-time racing intelligence**.
